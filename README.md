# CatPhotoApp Documentation
Part 1 - Building a Cat Photo App using HTML
I named this file **ruby.html** because I have a cat named Ruby. She is a lovely cat. :)

## Technology Used
- HTML5

## Lessons Learned
- Importance of structuring HTML in a semantic and accessible way.
- How to create forms and handle user input in HTML.

## What I Created
- A simple webpage for a CatPhotoApp with sections for cat photos, lists of things cats love and hate, and a form for users to submit information about their cats.

## Ideas for Improvement
- Add a CSS file to improve the visual appearance of the webpage.
- Use JavaScript to add interactivity to the form.

## Visuals

(The web page scales content to 80% of its original size to ensure full visibility within the viewport.)
