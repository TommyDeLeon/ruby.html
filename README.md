# 🐾 Project Documentation: Building a Cat Photo App using HTML 🐱‍💻
Welcome to Part 1 of our journey on freeCodeCamp! This project is affectionately named **ruby.html** after my lovely cat, Ruby. She's been a great source of inspiration! 😺

## 🛠️ Technology Used
This project is a purr-fect example of the power of **HTML**. It's the backbone of our webpage, structuring the content in a meaningful way.

## 🎓 Lessons Learned
This project was a deep dive into the world of semantic HTML elements. We learned how to:
- Structure a webpage using elements like main, section, header, footer, figure, figcaption, fieldset, and legend 📚
- Create a form complete with radio buttons, checkboxes, and a text input 📝

## 🎨 What Was Created
We crafted a webpage for a fictional CatPhotoApp. The webpage is a cat lover's paradise with sections for cat photos, lists of things cats love and hate, and a form for users to share information about their own feline friends. Each section is clearly labeled with a heading, and the form includes fieldsets to group related inputs together.

## 💡 Ideas to Make It Better
### Add CSS:
Our webpage is currently in its natural state, unstyled. Adding some CSS would dress it up, making it more visually appealing and improving the user experience. 🎨
### Add interactivity:
Let's bring our webpage to life with some JavaScript. Imagine being able to upload your own cat photos, or vote on your favorite photos! 📸
### Improve accessibility:
Let's make sure our webpage is accessible to all users. This could include adding more descriptive alt text for images, ensuring sufficient color contrast, and adding ARIA attributes where necessary. 🌐

## 📸 Visuals
Before we dive into the screenshots of our webpage, let's meet the inspiration behind the project's file name. Meet Ruby, my lovely cat! She's not just a cat, she's a muse. 😺

Now, take a look at some screenshots of our webpage:

(Note: The web page scales content to 80% of its original size to ensure full visibility within the viewport.)
